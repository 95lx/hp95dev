				 BOXES
=====================================================================

Boxes is a demo written for the HP 95LX to demonstrate the how-to's of
writing System Manager compliant applications (such as the
Appointment book, HP calc, Hearts & Bones, etc.).  System manager
apps have the advantage of being able to be hooked to a key, and
being multi-tasking (after a fashion) unlike normal DOS programs in the
95.  System manager apps will also have the same look and feel as
the rest of the built-in applications which may be advantageous for
the user's learning curve.

Boxes is a version of the simple "connect the boxes" game that many people
have played as children.  The object is for each player to own more boxes than
their opponent; the player to add the fourth and final side to a box is
the "owner" of that box.  The game can be played with either the computer
(which is not all that intelligent in its box choices) or another human
(and 95LX) over the infra-red port.

This game was written with the purpose of showing as many System Manager
function calls as possible (*not* as an exciting game premise), so each
call to the S.M. is documented.  All major areas of System Manager functions
except Resource/Help (which are available to built-in apps only), Clipboard,
Collating, and 1-2-3 Bridge are represented.  To keep the program manageable,
not all the functions have been used, but enough typical of a comprehensive
SysMgr app are included.  Note that the communications routines used for
two-player mode are relatively safe, but do not do robust ack/nak error
checking.  I.e. do not put your hand inbetween the two units during play,
or the program will quit the game(s)!  BOXES is not a demonstration of how
to write indestructible communications code!

The overall program structure is also documented at the beginning of
BOXES.C.  All calls have "prototypes" in the C header files that can
be looked at for more information.  For the grand scheme of things, look at
OVERVIEW.DOC for more pointers in putting a SysMgr app together. I strongly
suggest if you have not programmed a System Manager app before, that you
read through BOXES.C carefully, and read all the comments.  That way you
will be aware of any pecularities BEFORE you design your own code.  It may
also be useful to modify boxes slightly and download it to the 95LX to
try out various parameter changes (be sure to keep an original!).

System manager applications are event driven, not procedure driven as
normal C code.	The program spends its time in event loops until the
System Manager passes an event.  Events are related to timers, keystroke
input, or context switches.  What the program does with each particular
event is dependent on the state of the program at the time the event
is received.  This can be seen in BOXES by the use of the variable "states"
to keep track of the program state and to dispatch events accordingly.
BOXES also uses more than one event loop in cases where the old event
loop would be too cumbersome to put flags in (ESCmsg is one of these).
BOXES also uses all strings out of a string table; this is in preparation
for language localization.  Not all programs will need to be localized for
other countries, but you may want to seriously consider it before you start
coding.

All system manager apps should be written in the Small compiler
model with one code segment and one data segment.  Boxes uses MS C 6.0,
but the code should be relatively easy to compile under MS C 5.1; just
take out the inline assembly and replace it with calls to an assembly
object module.	Conversion to another compiler would require replacing
the CRT0.OBJ startup object module--quite possibly an arduous task.
