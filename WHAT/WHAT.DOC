NOTE!! Use of the included program and the information it reveals is done so
	at your own risk.  Hewlett-Packard Company and Lotus Development
	Corporation provide no support for the included information and have
	made no commitment to ensure that this information will remain the
	same in future ROM releases of the HP 95LX or any other products.

WHAT.EXM is a small SysMgr compliant test program that searches through the
SysMgr's data space, finds the Task Control Block (TCB) table, and displays
the address where the table is currently located (on the second line of the 
display), and displays a list of currently active tasks in the table and
their state.

NOTE!!! This is not a polished, completed application!!!!  If there's more
than 11 active tasks, it's not gracefully handled, etc.  The intent of this
is to show those of you who are interested a little more about the internals
of the SysMgr.

NOTE: TASK0 is the "business card", the thing that's ALWAYS in the table, the
	thing that gets control when all other tasks have been quit.
      SETUP and FILER will ALWAYS show up in the table, because their data
	spaces are always allocated, so that they can be run at any time, even
	if all other memory is taken up by other applications.

The t_extname starts out (after a boot) as the original filename of the program
that was used to build the ROM.  Once an application has been run, it
"registers" a name which will replace the original filename in the TCB entry.

NOTE: Built-in apps can be re-assigned to different keys by directly modifying
	the 't_hotkey' entry in the TCB table.

For those of you that have been playing around with HOTDOS to shell out to DOS
with SysMgr apps open, you should then be able to run DEBUG and examine/modify
this table in memory directly.

NOTE: There's a flag in the source code (SYSMGR) that allows the program to be
	compiled as either a SysMgr compliant app, or as a .COM program.
	Obviously, this program has little use as a .COM, but it's a heck of a
	lot easier to debug as a .COM!  I left this stuff in as an example of
	how this kind of thing could be done.
