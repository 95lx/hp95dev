ASMDEMO is an extremely simple assembly language program that shows the basic
shell structure of an assembly language System Manager compliant application
for the HP 95LX.

Basically, all it does is display one of three text screens, with the display
in either ALPHA or GRAPHICS mode.  While looking at the display, the only
differences you'll notice between ALPHA and GRAPHICS is that the blinking
cursor only shows in ALHPA mode, and the screen updates (writes) are slower
in GRAPHICS (more bytes to write, more overhead, etc).

The code is pretty self-explanatory. :-)

The only thing that I'd like to point out (in my limited time to do so), is
the SysMgr calls to write to the alpha display use a coordinate system where
column numbers range from 0 to 39 and row numbers range from -3 to 12.  The
strange row numbering is supposedly because the application screens all have
three rows of "header" info at the top of the display, so this puts the first
row of the applications "data" screen at row 0. <shrug of shoulders>

The included files are:

	ASMDEMO.ASM	the source code
	ASMDEMO.EXM	the SysMgr executable
	ASMDEMO.MAP	the LINKER map file (used by E2M, and included for ref)
	ASMDEMO		the MAKE file
	ASMDEMO.DOC	this file

Hope this can be of help to someone.
