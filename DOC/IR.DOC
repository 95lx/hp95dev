	INTRODUCTION

	The serial communication portion of the Hopper IC contains both
	wired RS232 and IR transmit and receive capabilities.  The RS232
	UART ports use an 8250 cell to control transmit and receive.  The
	IRO output port can be used for two types of communication, IR
	transmit and REDEYE.  REDEYE is used to transmit data to an
	infrared REDEYE printer port.  The IR communications portion uses
	both the IRO output to trnsmit and the IRI input pin to receive
	data.  These ports are used for wireless communication using
	infrared light.  The 8250 and the IR ports can be used
	simultaneously to implement a wireless UART mode.


	UART

	The serial UART block is implemented using an 8250 compatible
	macro cell.  A 1.8 MHz clock will be supplied for operation of
	this block.  The UART is addressed from 3F8h to 3FFh.  RS232 drive
	and receive circuits are provided off chip.

	The 1.8MHz UART clock is available in operating and light sleep
	modes.  The UART clock should be disabled to save power when the
	UART is not in use.  This is done by setting the 8250 baud rate
	divisor to zero.


	IR COMMUNICATION

	The IR communication block enables the Hopper IC to have wireless
	communication using an external infrared LED and IR receive
	circuit.  The IR communication block supports 5 separate
	communication formats.  These formats are REDEYE, Software
	controlled communication, Modulated communication, IR UART with
	both single pulse and multiple pulse communication.  To control
	the IR transmission of these formats, the hardware uses 2 control
	registers, the IRCNT register and the IRFMAT register.  The IRFMAT
	register at I/O register address E30Ah contains control bits that
	choose which format is chosen for IR communication.  These bits
	are as follows:

	bit  name	description
	____________________________________________________________________
	0    RED	This bit when set activates REDEYE transmit mode.
			It turns on the REDEYE transmit hardware and sets it
			to a state where it is waiting for input from software.
	1    MDLTE	This bit when set activates Modulated communication
			mode.  It turns on the modulation source and allows the
			MDLD bit in the IRCNT register to control the output
			of a modulated waveform.
	2    IRURT	This bit when set activates IR UART communication mode.
			This bit disconnects the 8250 from the RS232 pins and
			connects it to the IR communication block.  Software,
			after setting the PMOD and MDSEL bits in this register,
			just transmits and receives using 8250 as though it
			were connected to the RS232 ports.
	3    MDSEL	This bit is used to select the modulation source for
			both IR UART mode and Modulation communication mode.
				If this bit is 0, the 32kHz low frequency clock
			is chosen as the modulation source.  If it is set to 1,
			the 8250 baud rate generator 16x clock is used for the
			modulation source to be set at 38kHz to be remote
			control compatible.
	4    PMOD	This bit is used in IR UART mode to select between
			single pulse transmission and multiple pulse transmiss-
			ion.  If it is set to 0, a single pulse of duration
			equal to a half cycle time of the modulation source
			will be transmitted for a 0 output bit.  If it is set
			to 1, a pulse train of the modulation frequency will be
			used to transmit a 0.
	5    LBF	LED Buffer Full.  This bit is used in REDEYE mode to
			indicate that the contents of the LBR bit have not yet
			been transmitted and should not be written at this
			time.  Writing to the LBR automatically sets this bit.
			This bit is cleared when the LBR is transferred to the
			REDEYE formatter.
	6    ELBE	Enable Interrupt on LBR bit Empty (LBF clear).  If this
			bit is set and LBF is clear, an IR interrupt will
			occur.
	7    UNREG	This bit is used to test the HPIRO pad.  Setting it
			high disables regulation of the pad current.

	The IRCNT register at I/O register address E30Bh contains bits that are
	used to transmit a bit or waveform out on the IRO pad.  The IRCNT
	register also allows software to receive IR data in any of the formats
	that can be transmitted.  The contents are as follows:

	bit  name	description
	_____________________________________________________________________
	0    LED	This bit is used to turn on the IR LED connected to the
			HPIRO pad.  It is used for software controlled IR
			transmission.  When it is set to a 1, the IR LED is
			turned on.
	1    LBR	This bit contains the half-bit to be transmitted in
			REDEYE format.  Write a 1 to send an "on" half-bit or
			write a 0 to send an "off" half-bit.
	2    MDLD	This bit is used for software to output a serial wave-
			form to be modulated by the chosen modulation source.
			This allows compatibility with remote control format.
	5    IRE	IR Event.  This bit is set by a logic low voltage on
			the IRI pin.  It is set to indicate that an IR event
			has occurred.  Once set, software must reset this bit.
	6    EIRI	Enable IR interrupt.  An IR interrupt will occur if
			this bit and the IRE bit are both set.
	7    IRI	IR Input pin.  This bit allows software to monitor the
			state of the IRI pin.  It is a read only bit.

	Using the last three bits, software can receive each of the transmiss-
	ion formats described later.  Also, if IR UART mode is set, software
	can receive data using the 8250 the same as it would in RS232 mode.


	REDEYE FORMAT

	The REDEYE portion consists of the RED, LBF, and ELBE bits in the
	IRFMAT register, the LBR bit in the IRCNT register, the REDEYE
	formatter, and the IRO LED pin.  The LED pin has an open drain device
	and thus may be driven low or tristated only.  When driven low the
	drain current is somewhat regulated by a feedback circuit.  The LBF
	and LBR bits form a double buffered handshake mechanism that allow
	automatic REDEYE half-bit formatting and pacing.  An interrupt
	mechanism is provided to indicate completion of each half-bit.

	The REDEYE printer requires 15-bit frames of a precise format.  Each
	bit of the frame consists of two half-bits.  The duration of each
	half-bit is 14 cycles of the 32768 kHz crystal oscillator.  The half-
	bit is considerecd to be "on" if the LED is pulsed 6-8 times (out of
	the 14 possible) at the 32768 kHz rate.  Hopper's REDEYE port uses
	8 pulses.  The format of a complete REDEYE frame is shown below:

		Start-bits	Three half-bits "on-on-on"
		Hamming-bits	Four pairs of half-bits.
		Data-bits	Eight pairs of half-bits.  Each of the four
				hamming and eight data bits are encoded with
				two half-bits.  A "one" data or hamming bit is
				encoded by "on-off" and a zero is encoded by
				"off-on".
		Stop-bits	Three half-bits "off-off-off".  This is the
				minimum idle time required between frames.

	The ELBE, RED, LBF, and LBR bits are cleared at reset.  The REDEYE port
	also uses a formatter which is turned off whenver RED is cleared.
	Software initiates a half-bit transmission by writing a bit to LSR.
	This automatically sets the LBF flags in IRFMAT register and starts
	the state machine.  The state machine transfers the bit from LBR into
	the formatter and clears LBF.  If ELBE is set, this will cause an IR
	interrupt indicating that it is safe to write the next half-bit to LBR.
	The state machine then times the half-bit for 14 counts of the 32768 Hz
	crystal oscillator.  If the bit in the formatter is a 1, the LED is
	left off.  If after the 14 counts LBF is clear, the state machine will
	return to its idle state of waiting for LBF.  Otherwise, it will
	immediately transfer the next half-bit and start timing it.

	When LBF is clear and ELBE is set, an IR interrupt will occur.  When
	the state machine clears LBF, software has 13 counts of the oscillator
	to write the next bit to LBR.  Otherwise the length of the half-bits
	will not be correct.

		Through-put:
			32768 / 14 = 2340.6 baud (half-bits/sec)
			32768 / 28 = 1170.3 bps (bits/sec)
		REDEYE Frame Length
			1.5 start + 4 Hamming + 8 data + 1.5 stop = 15 bits
		REDEYE Through-put:
			1170.3 / 15 = 78.02 cps


	SOFTWARE CONTROLLED MODE

	The LED bit in IRCNT register is provided for software generated IR
	formats.  This bit is OR-ed with the output of the REDEYE formatter,
	and the other IR format outputs.  Therefore, two IR formats may not be
	used simultaneously.

	Due to LED current limitations, the LED output driver duty cycle must
	be limited to a time average of 29%.  The duty cycle is automatically
	limited to 1/2 x 8/14 or 28.6% by the REDEYE formatter.  The format of
	a full REDEYE frame yields a duty-cycle of only 14.3%.  If a different
	format is used (by using the LED bit) software must limit the duty-
	cycle.


	MODULATED MODE

	The MDLD bit in the IRCNT register can be used by software to output
	any custom modulated waveform desired.  To output a waveform, software
	must first set the MDLTE bit in the IRFMAT register and choose the
	modulation source using the MDSEL bit.  If the 8250 baud rate 16x
	clock is chosen, its frequency must be set to the desired modulation
	frequency.  Once this has been accomplished, software can set and
	clear the MDLD bit as desired to emulate the envelope of the output
	waveform.  Whenever MDLD is 1, pulses will be output of a 50% duty
	cycle for the given modulation source.  As before, care must be taken
	not to exceed the 29% communication duty cycle.


	IR UART MODES

	The 8250 may be used for half duplex IR communication of limited baud
	rate.  To use this mode the IRURT bit must be set in the IRFMAT
	register.  When this bit is set, the 8250 is disconnected from the
	RS232 ports and connected to the IR communication block.  When using
	this mode, software must first choose the transmission format.  The
	two possible formats are single pulse mode and multiple pulse mode.  If
	the PMOD bit is 0, single pulse mode is chosen.  In this mode, a single
	pulse of one half cycle of the modulation source is transmitted for a
	0.  In multiple pulse mode, a train of pulses of the modulation source
	is transmitted for a 0.  In both modes, a 1 is transmitted as no
	pulses.  As in Modulated mode, the modulation source again must be
	chosen.  If the baud rate of 2400 baud is chosen, choosing the 8250
	16x clock will give you a modulation rate of 38kHz.

	After this is set up, software can use the 8250 to communicate as
	though it were still connected to the RS232 ports.


	MISCELLANEOUS

	The IR input interrupt is tied to IRQ5 of the 8259 PIC.

	Bit 5 (of 0-7) of I/O address E301h is the IR circuit interrupt/wakeup
	enable.  This is a R/W register.  Modify bit 5 to 1 to enable the
	IR to interrupt.  When IR is used in UART mode, IR interrupt is not
	used, as everything appears to be coming in through the UART.
