HP 95LX Appointment Book File Format

The HP 95LX Appointment Book file is structured as a file-identification
record, followed by a settings record, followed by a variable number of data
records, and terminated by an end-of-file record. There are multiple types of
data records corresponding to the different types of appointment book entries.

The formats of these appointment book records is described in the following
tables. In the descriptions, the type <int> refers to a two-byte integer
stored least significant byte first, the type <swpint> refers to a two-byte
integer stored most significant byte first, the type <char> refers to a
one-byte integer, and the type <ASCII> refers to a string of ASCII
characters.

Notes:

1. Files created by the Appointment Book application may contain 
some padding following the last field of some data records.  Hence,
the RecordLength field must be used to determine the start of the
next record.  Appointment book files created by other programs need not
have any padding.

2. ApptState has several bit fields.  Only bit 0 is meaningful to software
processing an appointment book file.  Bit 0 being set or cleared 
corresponds to the alarm being enabled or disabled, respectively.
Programs creating Appointment book files should clear all bits, except
perhaps bit 0.

3. ToDoState has two one-bit bit fields.  Bit 0 being set or cleared
corresponds to carry forward being enabled or disabled for this todo
item, respectively.  Bit 1 being set or cleared corresponds to the doto 
being checked off or not checked off, respectively. 

4. Appointment and ToDo texts are each limited to a maximum of 27
characters.

5. Note text is limited to a maximum of 11 lines of 39 characters per line
(not counting the line terminator).
