 SERIAL
==============================================================================

The pinout of the serial connector, when looking INTO the serial port of the
HP 95LX, is:

	SHIELD		TRANSMIT	RECEIVE		SIGNAL
	GROUND		  DATA		 DATA		GROUND

SHIELD GROUND and SIGNAL GROUND are shorted together inside the HP 95LX, so
they're effectively the same.

==============================================================================
 THE _SYS DIRECTORY
==============================================================================

_SYS is a hidden sub-directory that mostly contains miscellaneous files of
use to the system, but of little or no interest to the user.  There are a few
things, however, that ARE of use.  The actual contents of this hidden directory
will vary, as "international" versions of the HP 95LX have less room in the
ROM due to the fact that they contain all messages and help screens in two
languages (English and the "local" language).  However, in the US versions of
the product, the _SYS directory contains these additional files of interest:

	DEBUG.EXE	The MS-DOS DEBUG program for DOS 3.22
	1000.PCX	A very nice alternative for the "business card"
	TFOX.EXM	A System Manager compliant version of TigerFox
	HB.EXM		A System Manager compliant game similar to minefield
	SERINT.COM	A program to enable/disable serial interrupts

_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_

 DEBUG is the standard program.  If you don't know how to use it, you can find
 out about it from almost any book about MS-DOS.

_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_

 To use 1000.PCX, go into the SETUP application, select OWNER, PICTURE-FILE,
 then enter "C:\_SYS\1000.PCX" as the file name.  Then, quit out of SETUP, and
 quit any other applications that you have running, until you reach the
 "business card".

_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_

 TFOX.EXM and HB.EXM are System Manager compliant games.  This means that they
 will act just like the other "blue key" applications, allowing you to switch
 between them and the other applications at the press of a key without having
 to quit them.  (TF.COM is in the root of drive C: and is documented in an
 appendix of the manual.  It is a non-System Manager compliant version of the
 game and can ONLY be run when all other applications are closed, except for
 the filer).  To use TFOX.EXM and/or HB.EXM, use the MEMO to create a file
 called "C:\_DAT\APNAME.LST".  In that file, place this text:

   C:\_SYS\TFOX.EXM,1400,TigerFox
   C:\_SYS\HB.EXM,2300,Hearts & Bones

 After creating this file, reboot the machine by pressing CTL-ALT-DEL (be sure
 that you've closed any data files that any applications might be working
 with before re-booting, as any unsaved changes would be lost).

 Now, after re-booting, ALT-T and ALT-H are the "hot" keys for accessing these
 two programs.  The entries in the APNAME.LST file consist of three components:
   1) The pathname to the program.
   2) The scancode for the key to which you wish it to be mapped.
   3) The name that you want to appear in the low-memory "close-out" box,
        if you should run out of memory and need to close an application.

 The HP 95LX supports a maximum of eight entries in the APNAME.LST file.  Also,
 the drive letter (the first character on each line) should be capitalized (it
 may work most of the time with lower case, but this is not guaranteed in all
 situations).

 Drive A: can also have an APNAME.LST file (in the root directory) for .EXM
 files on drive A:.  The format is exactly the same.  Of course, the pathnames
 in the drive A: APNAME.LST should start with A: instead of C:.  Do NOT put
 entries in the APNAME.LST file on drive A: that specify a drive letter other
 than drive A:, and do NOT put entries in the drive C: APNAME.LST file that
 specify a drive letter other than drive C:.  If you do this, you won't get
 an error message, but things probably won't work very well either.

_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_

 SERINT.COM is a small program that simply allows you to disable/enable the
 interrupts from the serial port.  On a normal PC, the serial port interrupts
 are disabled by default, whereas on the HP 95LX, they're ENABLED by default.
 If this causes problems when running programs which don't come with the
 HP 95LX you can use SERINT to correct the problem before running those
 programs.  (Problems are only likely to occur with programs which use the
 serial port by making calls to the BIOS INT 14 code, so 99.5% of people will
 have no need for the program.)

 If you run SERINT with no arguments it will display a VERY brief syntax
 description.  There's basically two options:
	SERINT /D	disables the UART from interrupting
	SERINT /E	enables the UART to interrupt

==============================================================================
 TSR's, THE SYSTEM MANAGER, and EVERYTHING
==============================================================================

TSR's present a special problem for the the HP 95LX.  Under many circumstances
you can run TSR's from the Filer or from the DOS command line, just like any
other DOS program.  However, this can cause a couple of problems.  One is
memory fragmentation if the TSR is run from the DOS command line.  This is
because the System Manager has run a copy of COMMAND.COM which has allocated
some data space in the low end of memory.  Then, the TSR gets run which
permanently allocates a block of memory above that.  Now, when you exit
COMMAND.COM and go back to the System Manager, you have a small "hole" in
memory where COMMAND's data was.  This "hole" may or may not be useable by
the System Manager.  The only side effect of this, in terms of memory usage,
is that in some extreme cases, you might run out of memory when you otherwise
wouldn't have.

A more important drawback of running TSR's from the Filer or from the DOS
command prompt is that they then block the System Manager's ability to run
RAM-based System Manager-compliant applications (those programs that get
assigned to a "hot key" via the APNAME.LST file).  This is not so good.

An alternate way to run the TSR is this:  create a CONFIG.SYS file with the
line
		SHELL=COMMAND /P
and an AUTOEXEC.BAT file that runs the TSR and then the System Manager, some-
thing like:
		TSRNAME
		$SYSMGR
This will cause the TSR to get loaded into memory first, BEFORE the System
Manager, and thus won't screw up the System Manager's memory management.

However, there's drawbacks to this, also.  The System Manager takes over some
interrupt vectors without "chaining" on to the previous owner.  This means
that if your TSR takes a vector that the System Manager also takes, your TSR
may not get control back when it expects to.

The System Manager takes these vectors:

	INT  5	Print Screen
	INT  6	Internal BIOS hook involving entering & leaving sleep modes
		 This is intended for internal uses only, and should not be
		 mucked with.
	INT  C	(IRQ 4) Serial port interrupts
	INT 1B	CTRL-BREAK (the old value is saved, and then restored before
		 shelling to DOS COMMAND)
	INT 1C	18.2 Hz timer tick application hook.  The System Manager
		 "chains" this vector, so previous owners will still get
		 control.
	INT 4A	User Alarm - BIOS calls this when an alarm goes off. Proper
		 functioning of this interrupt is integral to the Appointment
		 Book alarm system, so it should not be mucked with.
	INT 60	Calls to the System Manager
	INT 61	Used by the System Manager to load its DS register

HP 95LX DISPLAY REFRESH RATE
==============================================================================

The frame rate (the number of times the LCD is scanned, or refreshed per
second) for the HP 95LX changes, depending upon whether or not the AC adapter
is plugged in.  When the AC adapter is plugged in, the LCD refresh rate is
73.14 Hz.  When the AC adapter is not plugged in (ie, running off of batteries)
the refresh rate is 56.8 Hz.
