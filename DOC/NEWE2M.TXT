Update on using Borland C to create .EXM files for the HP95LX
***********************************************************************

If you read "Using Borland C to create .EXM...", you probably
were disappointed to realize E2M did not support Turbo .MAP files.

The good news is: it now does!  The new version of E2M will recognize
both Turbo and Microsoft .MAP files, so you don't need to do any special
fixups on your .MAP file to trick E2M into choking it down.
The Turbo/Microsoft version E2M.EXE file is 4.2.

If you didn't read it already, here is the text of the original message,
updated to reflect the new E2M:

-------------------------------

Yes, believe it or not, you can use Borland tools to create System
Manager compliant applications for the 95LX!  Although this has been
tested only with Turbo C++ and Borland C++, it should work for the whole
Turbo C family.  The two basic problems to work around are the startup
code and the E2M program.

(NOTE: TKERNEL is a PC TSR that provides the SysMgr services on the PC,
  in a non-task-swapping environment, allowing you to debug your program
  on a PC, using standard PC debuggers.  Unfortunately, this program is
  property of Lotus Corporation, which as decided NOT to allow its
  distribution to anyone EXCEPT for ISV's that have been accepted into
  the supported ISV program.  However, the rest of this note (regarding
  creating .EXM files for use on the HP 95LX), is applicable even if you
  DON'T have access to TKERNEL.)

To create programs to run under TKERNEL, you shouldn't need to do
anything special.  Just make sure to link in CSVC.OBJ (included in the
ISV kit and on the HP BBS) so the c_service routines are defined.  Since
you will probably want to use the Turbo C integrated environment, MAKE
SURE YOU INCLUDE any #defines that the Microsoft make file may jam in
before you compile.  BOXES.C is an example of this: it defines TKERNEL
from the make file for the tkernel file, but does not for the EXM file.
If you run non-TKERNEL code under TKERNEL you will almost certainly have
problems (eg. Divide overflow) since TKERNEL doesn't support the full
set of System Manager functions.

STEP 1
------
To create .EXM programs for the System Manager, it gets a little more
complicated.  First of all, you need to trick Turbo C into leaving out
its own startup code and including CRT0.OBJ (also included in the ISV
kit / HP BBS).	CRT0 is just about the minimum that is needed upon
startup so the program doesn't do all kinds of funny stuff on the 95
that isn't supported.  To do this, go to the directory that you keep
your CRT0.OBJ and CSVC.OBJ files (assume it is \HP95\TOOLS) , and copy
CRT0.OBJ into a new file, C0S.OBJ.	C0S.OBJ is the file that Turbo C
uses for small model startup code, so we're just replacing it.

Now go into the integrated environment under Options/Directory/Libraries,
and insert the directory name \HP95\TOOLS; (or whatever you use) *in
front* of what currently lies there (so it will find our "fake" C0S
first). Also remember to link in CSVC.OBJ as well (just add it to your
project file). Now you should be able to compile your SysMgr app with no
problems. (Other helpful hints on compiling:  Remember under small model
code only, no floating point code, and don't link in the graphics
library.)

STEP 2
------
Step 1 will get you a .EXE, but you still need to run E2M to
produce the .EXM file that will end up in the 95LX.  The E2M program
relies on the .MAP file to deduce the data/code segment dividing point.
If you don't already have it set, go into Options/Linker/Mapfile, and
set it to Segments (if you have more map info in the file, that's okay,
but Segments is needed at least).

Run the new version of E2M on your .EXE file!

For those of us who would much rather use Borland tools (present company
included), this fix ought to make System Manager programming a little more
palatable.
