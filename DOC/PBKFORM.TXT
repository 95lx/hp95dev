HP 95LX Phone Book File Format

The HP 95LX Phone Book file is structured as a file identification 
record, followed by a variable number of phone book data records, 
and terminated by an end of file record.  Each data record contains
the information for one phone book entry.

The format of these phone book records is described below.  In the
descriptions, the type <int> refers to a two byte integer stored least 
significant byte first, the type <char> refers to a one byte integer, 
and the type <ASCII> refers to a string of ASCII characters.

                                          to a maximum of 8 lines of 39
                                          characters per line (not counting
                                          the line terminator).

Byte Offset      Name            Type     Contents

Note: Files created by the Phone Book application may contain 
some padding following the last field of some data records.  Hence,
the RecordLength field must be used to determine the start of the
next record.  Phone book files created by other programs need not
have any padding.
